# google-ad-block-extension

I was getting bored by annoying ads displaying on the top, bottom or side bar of good search result. So I wanted to stop that. I had Adblock plus extension but it was just blocking ads from other websites not from Google search result page. So I built extension to stop those ads from displaying. This also stop annotations which display on YouTube video while we watch it. Tell me what you think about this.

## Features:

1) Block ads from top, bottom, side bar of google search result page. <br />
2) Block annotations from youtube.<br />
3) Block ads displayed while watching youtube videos.<br />

## To install extension in chrome follow this steps:

1) Download extension zip folder and extract it.<br />
2) Open Google chrome -> Settings -> Extensions. <br />
3) Click "Load unpacked extension" button and select the extracted ad block extension folder. <br />
4)	Enjoy...

##Output

Google search result for query "home loan" without use of my extension <br/>
